# Getting Started Guide

## üéØ Your First 15 Minutes

Welcome! This guide will get you up and running in just 15 minutes.

---

## Step 1: Verify Prerequisites (2 minutes)

Check that you have everything installed:

```bash
# Check Docker
docker --version
# Should output: Docker version 20.x.x or higher

# Check Python
python3 --version
# Should output: Python 3.8 or higher

# Check Node.js
node --version
# Should output: v14.x.x or higher
```

**Don't have one?**
- Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/

---

## Step 2: Run the Setup Script (5 minutes)

Choose based on your operating system:

### Linux / macOS
```bash
cd /path/to/project
bash setup.sh
```

### Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell)
```bash
cd \path\to\project
setup.bat
```

**What the script does:**
1. ‚úì Checks prerequisites
2. ‚úì Starts MQTT broker in Docker
3. ‚úì Creates Python virtual environment
4. ‚úì Installs Python dependencies
5. ‚úì Installs Node.js dependencies

---

## Step 3: Start the Services (5 minutes)

Open **3 separate terminals/command prompts** and run:

### Terminal 1: Start MQTT Broker
```bash
docker-compose up -d mosquitto
# Output: smart_home_mqtt_broker ... done

# Verify it's running
docker ps | grep mosquitto
```

### Terminal 2: Start Backend
```bash
cd backend

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Run Flask backend
python app.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Press CTRL+C to quit
```

### Terminal 3: Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start React development server
npm start
```

**Expected output:**
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view your app in the browser at:
  http://localhost:3000
```

---

## üéì Learning Path

### Path 1: Understand Safe Operations (5 minutes)
1. Go to Dashboard - understand system
2. Go to Device Controls - safely control a device
3. Go to Dashboard - see the event logged
4. Go to Defense & Logs - see DEVICE_UPDATE event

### Path 2: Learn Attack Detection (10 minutes)
1. Read the "Perform Attack" tab education section
2. Try one attack (e.g., Unauthorized Control)
3. Check Defense tab for attack log
4. Read the attack details
5. Try different attack types
6. Compare in logs

### Path 3: Study Security Events (5 minutes)
1. Perform some safe device controls
2. Perform some attacks
3. Go to Defense & Logs
4. Filter different log types
5. Study the events and timestamps
6. Understand what was detected

---

## üîç What to Try Next

### 1. Test Multiple Attacks
```
Try Each Attack Type:
‚ñ° Unauthorized Device Control
‚ñ° Authentication Bypass
‚ñ° Denial of Service (DoS)
‚ñ° Malformed Messages

Result: Each appears in Defense logs with different details
```

### 2. Test Authorization
```
Try This:
1. Logout (top right button)
2. Login with user2/demo
3. Go to Device Controls
4. Try to control Light 2 (should be denied!)
5. Go to Defense & Logs
6. See the authorization failure

Result: Limited users have fewer device access
```

### 3. Test Real-time Updates
```
Try This:
1. Open Dashboard in one tab
2. Go to Device Controls in another tab
3. Control a device
4. Go back to Dashboard - it updates automatically!

Result: Real-time MQTT synchronization works
```

### 4. Monitor Events
```
Try This:
1. Perform several actions (controls + attacks)
2. Go to Defense & Logs
3. Filter by different types
4. Watch timestamps
5. Clear logs and do it again

Result: Comprehensive audit trail
```

# Check if npm start is running
# You should see "Compiled successfully!" message

# If not, try:
cd frontend
npm start

# If still not working:
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

### "Backend connection refused (5000)"
```bash
# Check if Flask is running
# You should see "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"

# If not, try:
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py

# If still not working:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### "MQTT connection refused (1883/9001)"
```bash
# Check if MQTT is running
docker ps | grep mosquitto
# Should show smart_home_mqtt_broker

# If not running:
docker-compose up -d mosquitto

# If Docker not running:
# Start Docker Desktop app
```

### "Login fails"
- **Username**: Can be anything (e.g., user1, testuser, admin)
- **Password**: Must be exactly `demo` (case-sensitive!)
- Try: `user1` / `demo`

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Watch the Logs in Real-time**
   - Open Defense & Logs in one tab
   - Perform actions in another tab
   - Logs update automatically (refresh every 3 seconds)

2. **Understand Attack Types**
   - Each attack type has different detection logic
   - Read the descriptions before trying
   - Study what makes each attack detectable

3. **Test Authorization**
   - Login with different users (user1 vs user2)
   - Notice different device access levels
   - Try unauthorized device access

4. **Read the Code**
   - Comments explain everything
   - Start with `backend/app.py` - main logic
   - Then explore components in `frontend/src/`

5. **Monitor System Status**
   - Dashboard shows MQTT connection status
   - Green = connected, Red = disconnected
   - If red, check MQTT broker (docker-compose logs mosquitto)
