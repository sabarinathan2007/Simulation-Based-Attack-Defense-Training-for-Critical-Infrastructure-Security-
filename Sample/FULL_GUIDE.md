## üîß COMPLETE INSTALLATION PROCESS

### PHASE 1: Project Setup (5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd "c:\Users\vnada\OneDrive\Documents\Cyber_Project\Simulation-Based-Attack-Defense-Training-for-Critical-Infrastructure-Security-\Sample"
```

#### Step 2: Verify Project Structure
Your project folder should contain:
```
Sample/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/              (Flask application)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/             (React application)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml    (MQTT configuration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mosquitto.conf        (MQTT settings)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            (Quick reference)
```

**If missing any folders**, extract them or clone the repository.

---

### PHASE 2: Start MQTT Broker (3 minutes)

The MQTT broker is the communication hub for all devices and messages.

#### Step 3: Start Docker Services
```bash
# From the project root directory
docker-compose up -d

# Verify it's running
docker ps

# You should see 'smart_home_mqtt_broker' running
```

#### Step 4: Verify MQTT is Running
```bash
# Check logs for any errors
docker-compose logs mosquitto

# Look for: "mosquitto version X.X.X ready"
```

**If MQTT fails to start:**
- Check if ports 1883 and 9001 are available
- Run `docker-compose logs mosquitto` for error messages
- See Troubleshooting section

---

### PHASE 3: Setup Backend (7 minutes)

The backend handles API requests, device control, and attack detection.

#### Step 5: Create Python Virtual Environment
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# You should see (venv) in your terminal
```

#### Step 6: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Make sure you're in backend folder with venv activated
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Wait for all packages to install
# Should see "Successfully installed X packages"
```

#### Step 7: Start Flask Backend
```bash
# Run the Flask application
python app.py

# You should see:
# * Running on http://localhost:5000
# * WARNING: Development server running in production mode
```

**Keep this terminal window open** - Flask must keep running

**If Flask won't start:**
- Check if port 5000 is available
- Verify MQTT broker is running
- See Troubleshooting section

---

### PHASE 4: Setup Frontend (5 minutes)

The frontend is the user dashboard where you control devices and simulate attacks.

#### Step 8: Open New Terminal Window
Don't close the Flask terminal. Open a **new terminal window** and navigate:
```bash
cd "c:\Users\vnada\OneDrive\Documents\Cyber_Project\Simulation-Based-Attack-Defense-Training-for-Critical-Infrastructure-Security-\Sample\frontend"
```

#### Step 9: Install Node Packages
```bash
# Install all React dependencies
npm install

# This may take 2-3 minutes
# Should complete without errors
```

#### Step 10: Start React Application
```bash
# Start the development server
npm start

# Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:3000
# If not, open it manually
```

**Keep this terminal window open too** - React development server must keep running

// Detected as attack:
{"action": "on", "attack": true}
{"action": "on", "bypass_auth": true}
{"action": "on", "rapid_fire": true}
```

#### 2. Malformed/Invalid Messages
```json
// Invalid JSON - detected
{invalid json content}

// Missing required fields - detected
{"action": "on"}  // Missing device info
```

#### 3. Unauthorized Users
```
‚Ä¢ User not logged in
‚Ä¢ User accessing device they don't own
‚Ä¢ Session token invalid/expired
```

#### 4. Rate Limit Violations
```
‚Ä¢ More than X commands per minute
‚Ä¢ Rapid repetition of same command
‚Ä¢ Burst of commands from same user
```

### Database Structure
